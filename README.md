# Weather-App
A simple Python app that fetches weather data from an API and displays it in a GUI.

# What It Does
- Pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Shows current temperature, conditions, and forecast
- Tells you if you need an umbrella
- Updates on demand

# Why I Built This
I built the app to learn how to:
- Make API calls in Python
- Handle JSON responses
- Build a basic GUI
- Integrate API data with a user interface

# How to Use
Clone the repo
Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run python weather_app.py
Click "Update Weather" for fresh data

# What I Learned
- Working with API endpoints
- Parsing JSON data
- Creating a simple Tkinter GUI
- Error handling in API requests
- Displaying dynamic data in a GUI

# Next Steps
- Add user input for different locations
- Implement more detailed forecast
- Improve error handling and user feedback

Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own API-based projects!
